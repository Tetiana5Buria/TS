## 📒 Description:
This repository contains tasks for learning the syntax of the strongly typed programming language TypeScript.

*Understanding TypeScript Compilation to JavaScript:
Familiarizing with the compilation process that transforms TypeScript code into standard JavaScript.

*Working with the tsconfig.json configuration file to customize compilation settings.

*Studying Data Types and Their Usage:
Typing function arguments to ensure strict control over the values passed.

*Basic types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, any, etc.) and composite types.

*Using Function Signatures:
Defining functions with signatures to explicitly specify the types of data the function expects as parameters and what it returns.

*Optional Properties:
Working with data structures where some fields may be optional (? in type declarations).

*Writing functions capable of handling objects with missing fields.

*Union Types:
Exploring types that can accept multiple possible values (e.g., number | string).

*Using the Record Type:
Utilizing a special type that enables the creation of objects with a fixed set of keys and values of a specified type.
